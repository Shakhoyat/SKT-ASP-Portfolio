# Roslyn Compiler Fix

## Problem
The ASP.NET application was experiencing the following error:
```
Could not find a part of the path 'E:\asp3\bin\roslyn\csc.exe'
```

This occurs because the Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform NuGet package requires the Roslyn compiler files to be in the bin\roslyn directory, but these files were not properly copied during the build process.

## Solution
We've fixed this issue by:

1. Creating the required bin\roslyn directory
2. Downloading the Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform package
3. Copying the Roslyn compiler files from the package to the bin\roslyn directory

The fix-roslyn.ps1 PowerShell script performs these actions automatically.

## Additional Improvement
We've also added a RoslynCompilerFiles.targets file that ensures the Roslyn compiler files are properly copied during the build process in the future.

## Future Reference
If you encounter this error again after updating packages or in a new project:

1. Run the fix-roslyn.ps1 script
2. Make sure the RoslynCompilerFiles.targets file is included in your project

## Technical Details
- The issue is specific to projects using Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform
- The error occurs when the Roslyn compiler files are missing from the bin\roslyn directory
- The package uses these files for runtime compilation of C# code
- The Web.config references the package in the system.codedom section

## Alternative Solutions
If the provided fix doesn't work, you can try:

1. Reinstalling the Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform NuGet package
2. Using Package Manager Console: Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -reinstall
3. Manually copying the compiler files from packages\Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform.2.0.1\tools\Roslyn45 to bin\roslyn
